To prepare for the exploration of variables and data types in Python, students can begin with a task where they declare and use variables to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

addition = 12 + 3
subtraction = 




Next, they should experiment with different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans, understanding how Python handles each. 



Lastly, students can attempt to store user input in variables and display the results, gaining hands-on experience with variable manipulation and data persistence in Python. This practical task will solidify their understanding of Python's foundational concepts.
