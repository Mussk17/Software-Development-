# Create a program that takes user input, performs a mathematical operation like calculating the area of a shape, and displays the result. 

width = int(input("Please enter width: "))
length = int(input("Please enter length: "))

area_of_rectangle = width * length
result = f"The result of operation is: {area_of_rectangle}"
print(result)
